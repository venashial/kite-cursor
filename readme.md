## ðŸ§© Browser extension

### Firefox

Install the Firefox extension from the [Kite Cursor page on Firefox Addons.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kite-cursor/)

### Chrome, Edge, & Brave

> The extension is currently under review on the Chrome Web Store. For now, you have to build the project locally, and install the unpacked extension from the folder `dist/extension/v3`

## ðŸšš Import usage

### NPM

Install it:

```bash
npm install kite-curor
```

Add this to start `KiteCursor`:

```js
import { KiteCursor } from "kite-cursor";

new KiteCursor();
```

### Plain JS

> There are currently no plain JS imports. You can import an older version with: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kite-cursor@0.0.1/bin/minified.js"></script>`

## ðŸ’» Developing

First, make sure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) & [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#nodejs-is-preinstalled) are installed, then run:

```sh
pnpm install # Install dependencies
```

### Packaging extension

Package the extension by running:

```sh
pnpm package
```

Then, compress the outputs to `.zips`:

- `dist/extension/v2` for Firefox

pnpm dev # Run docs site locally for testing
pnpm package # Combines src/ into package
pnpm docs:build # Build docs site

Thanks to [@guerrillacontra](https://github.com/guerrillacontra/) for their [rope](https://codepen.io/guerrillacontra/pen/zJaREd) and [canvas lib](https://codepen.io/guerrillacontra/pen/zJaREd) codepens. This project uses that source code but refactored to use Typescript and specialized functions. Plus the fun kite parts!
